      <b>Worker Incident Report (05/12/99)</b><br><br>
      One worker has been found semi-conscious near the maintenance tunnel edge. Individual was rushed to St. Amelia Hospital in critical condition. After several days, individual regained enough lucidity to recall the experience: Reported being followed by a tall shadowy figure inside the tunnels with features matching descriptions previously retrieved. Described confusion, dizziness, and a subtle foul odor in days leading to incident. Symptoms included severe disorientation and respiratory distress before losing consciousness. Medical evaluation ongoing; toxicology pending.<br><br>

      </center>
      <b>05/19/99</b><br>
      <u>Following comprehensive testing by Hazmat and state environmental authorities, all fatalities previously investigated as homicides have been reclassified as accidental toxic exposures.</u><br><br>

      A previously unaccounted containment line was found ruptured beneath the Eastview Development construction site. The rupture had released long‑sealed industrial gases into adjacent drainage and utility structures. These gases are now known to cause progressive disorientation, hallucinations, paranoia, and fatal respiratory failure after prolonged exposure.<br><br>

      All prior reports of a figure are consistent with gas‑induced sensory disturbances and paranoia rather than the presence of a suspect. No evidence of foul play has been confirmed. However, authorities continue to search for evidence of conspiracy.<br><br>

      Construction remains suspended while remediation is underway. Environmental and legal teams are now coordinating efforts to assess potential negligence in the land’s transfer to Eastview Development. Preliminary findings indicate discrepancies in historical site records and safety certifications provided during the sale.<br><br>
